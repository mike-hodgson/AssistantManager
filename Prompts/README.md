# 📑 Prompts Folder

This folder contains **developer scaffolding prompts and Copilot instructions** for the AssistantManager solution.  
These files are not part of the runtime application — they exist to guide GitHub Copilot and developers when generating or extending the project framework.

## 📂 Contents

- **PromptKit.md**  
  Modular prompt starter kit with annotated instructions for Copilot.  
  Defines scaffolding prompts for models, ViewModels, UI pages, components, training modules, and interop logic.

- **COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**  
  Architecture and workflow guide for Copilot.  
  Covers project structure, feature modules, suspension logic, interop workflow, testing workflow, and deployment notes.

- **README.md** (this file)  
  Explains the purpose of the Prompts folder.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Keep all **Copilot guidance** in one place.  
- Ensure scaffolding prompts are **solution‑wide**, not tied only to the Client project.  
- Provide a clear reference for developers working on AssistantManager.  
- Support iterative development by keeping instructions modular and easy to update.

## 🔧 Notes

- These files should **not** be included in builds or deployments.  
- They are **developer aids only**.  
- If collaborating, point contributors to this folder for Copilot scaffolding guidance.
